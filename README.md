#DCUBuddy

DCUBuddy presents a chatbot which answers text-based queries from the user.
The chatbot provides useful campus-related information including information on
assignments and timetables. The ultimate aim is to provide an alternative platform to
the current Loop1 system, by presenting some of the more dynamic information
requirements that a student would need at short notice.
DCUBuddyâ€™s main target user would be a first-year student of DCU who may be
unfamiliar with certain fundamental aspects of campus navigation. Users can access
information on assignments, timetable and campus maps. There is a certain amount
of general information which can also be queried.
